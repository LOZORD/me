# Me, Leo Rudberg
Welcome to my personal website! No, seriously!

I have recently graduated from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu),
where I majored in [Computer Sciences](http://cs.wisc.edu) and [Mathematics](http://math.wisc.edu).

This upcoming September, I will be joining [Google](https://google.com) in their New York office as a Software Engineering Resident.

See the [__News__](#news) section to learn what I've been up to most recently.

Being a busy hacking hedge knight/console cowboy/college student/intern leaves
me with little time to worry about maintaining a nice personal site. Plus, this
is free, and I :heart: git!

I have old information [here](http://cs.wisc.edu/~leo).

This is what I look like:

Take a look around...
