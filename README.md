# Me, Leo Rudberg
Welcome to my personal website! No, seriously!

I'm a soon-to-be fourth year student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu),
where I'm majoring in [Computer Sciences](http://cs.wisc.edu) and [Mathematics](http://math.wisc.edu).

See the __News__ section to learn what I've been up to most recently.

Being a busy hacking hedge knight/console cowboy/college student/intern leaves
me with little time to worry about maintaining a nice personal site. Plus, this
is free, and I love git!

I have old information [here](http://cs.wisc.edu:~leo).

This is what I look like:

Take a look around:

## News

### [Paradrop](http://paradrop.io)
Paradrop is a research project/startup out of the WiNGS Networking Lab at UW-Madison.
From May '14-'15, I worked as a front-end dev for the website that interfaces with our
neat little access points. The goal of Paradrop is to add intelligence to your router.
It's IOT, baby!
### [Intuit QuickBooks Online](http://quickbooks.intuit.com)
For summer '15, I'm in the wonderful Bay Area of California working for Intuit. I'm helping
