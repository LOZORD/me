# Me, Leo Rudberg
Welcome to my personal website! No, seriously!

I am currently a software engineer at [Google](https://google.com), working on developer tools and infrastructure for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

See the [__News__](#news) section to learn what I've been up to most recently.

Being a busy hacking hedge knight/console cowboy/professional nosher leaves
me with little time to worry about maintaining a nice personal site. Plus, this
is free, and I :heart: git!

I have old information [here](http://cs.wisc.edu/~leo).

This is what I look like:

Take a look around...
