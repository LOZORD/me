# Me, Leo Rudberg
Welcome to my personal website! No, seriously!

I am currently a software engineer at [Google](https://google.com), working on iOS developer tools and infrastructure.

See the [__News__](#news) section to learn what I've been up to most recently.

Being a busy hacking [hedge knight](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Hedge_knight)/[console cowboy](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Case)/professional nosher leaves
me with little time to worry about maintaining a nice personal site. Plus, this
is free, and I :heart: git!

I have old information [here](http://cs.wisc.edu/~leo).

This is what I look like (circa 2015):
