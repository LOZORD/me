# Hacking What's Mine
December 2018

If you know me, you know that I love music and that I loved my 2011 17" Matte Display Mac Book Pro. The latter sadly passed away in the spring of 2018. Being a savvy technologist, I had backed up my computer semi-frequently using Apple's Time Capsule device. My old MBP held a lot of music on my iTunes account; music that came from either digital downloads or from CD rips using the built-in drive (now a somewhat archaic method). Thankfully, all of my music is on my Time Capsule.

My backup computer was a 2013 MacBook air that had suffered some water damage. I was able to resurrect it from the grave of non-booting by literally installing Ubuntu. On startup, OSX apparently check via some sensor if the electronics have suffered any water damage. Thankfully, Ubuntu doesn't care about this check, and I am able to use the laptop modulo some broken keys.

So, this post will explain my efforts in extracting my music library sealed within my Time Capsule onto my Ubunutu MBA so I can upload it to Google Play Music (free storage and my new Pixel phone being the main motivators).
