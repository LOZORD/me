# Ideas

Here are some hackathon/project/app/etc. I've had.

I've been working on this as a private Trello board for since 2013 or so.
But I thought it might be beneficial if I made it open.
I will probably never get to most of these, and a lot of them are half-baked.
Feel free to take any of them. Just let me know so I can add a link to your project!

## Web

- A web app that allows people to create music playlists as a community
- Instagram "competition" website
- A website that allows you to photoshop your friends' (but not your own) Instagram photos
- A recipe interpreter that substitutes unhealthy ingredients for healthy ones
- Cards Against Humanity Twitter bot
- A website that helps to stop domain squatters and to broker deals
- Spoken word/slam poetry/English education teaching app
- A website that lets people post potential events and see who would be interested in joining
  - A similar website, but for going to restaurants
- A web service that allows students to do inTRAnational school exchange (sort of like a long-term REU)
- "What's the world's favorite color?"
  A website that receives a person's favorite color and then adds it to the average color of the background of the website.
  It would also collect their location and map the color to a zone on the site.

## Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing

- Can we program gullibility?
  A "simple" CLI program (would probably ressemble Prolog) that would represent a gullible AI.
- An NLP CLI tool that colorizes and categorizes output for the Linux `cal` command.
- A program that translates common English to Carnegie's simplified English.
- A Twitter bot whose sole job is, when given another user's handle, to produce humorous profile picture edits or insults.
- An "iconoclastic" Twitter bot: find stuff with positive remarks/reviews and create new negative Tweets
- A CSS/JS extension for outputting formatted images from [this library](https://github.com/jaysalvat/jquery.facedetection/tree/master)
- Derive a typeface using an evolutionary algorithm. It should go from square blocks to readable letters.
